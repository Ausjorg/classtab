# Classtab

Classical Guitar Tabs originally from [ClassTab](http://classtab.org)

## Why?

Because I love good guitar tabs, and this is meant to be a continually improving
version of the current site.

## What's next?

### Minor

* Working to get involvement from the current site maintainers
* More difficulty classifications and filtering
* Cleaning JSON and getting meta information down correctly

### Major

* Backend server (likely Rails)
* Bookmarking
* Moderated Approvals
* Rating system
* Multi Version of same tab
* Requests

## How can I help?

Non-Devs: Open an issue on here and ask.
Devs: Fork away, and I'll take a look.
